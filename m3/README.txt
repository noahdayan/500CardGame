Beware when testing the AIs:
	> Running the driver 10000 times takes at least one hour to complete
	  due to the speed of the advanced AI calculations.
	  
When running the FHGUI:
	> The rate at which the cards move differ between operating systems.
	> This can be changed in DisplayableLabelledCard class, if the cards
		move too fast, increase the number, but this should be unnecessary.
	> Apologies for the unconventional card backs.
	
No Code Reuse!
